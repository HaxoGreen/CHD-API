                    "summary": "The latest staff survey showed  NHS staff engagement is at a 5 year high. We will continue to invest in and support NHS staff to help deliver safe, high quality patient care every day of the week.",
                    "details": "We know NHS staff work incredibly hard to provide outstanding patient care around the clock. Patient safety is the absolute priority for NHS staff and the Government.  That is why our manifesto committed to improve patient care across 7 days of the week, with a particular focus on emergency and urgent care at weekends. The current medical contracts were drawn up in the early 2000s, and there is widespread consensus that they now require reform, partly in order to support improvements in urgent and emergency weekend care through more modern and flexible contractual arrangements. We have been trying for 4 years to agree the necessary changes with the doctors’ trade union, the BMA. Sadly, despite undertaking 3 independent processes to try to reach a negotiated solution, it has not been possible. The contract we are therefore introducing was recommended by one of the NHS’ most successful and respected Chief Executives, Sir David Dalton. He was commissioned at the end of 2015 to lead negotiations on behalf of the NHS with authority to compromise on every issue under discussion. He successfully reached agreement with the BMA on approximately 90% of issues on the table, leaving the final unresolved issue of Saturday pay rates. The process Sir David undertook followed 2 previous independent processes. Last July the DDDRB published recommendations following representations from both sides. The BMA refused even to discuss their recommendations and balloted for strike action on the back of them. Last December the Government and NHS entered detailed discussions with the BMA through ACAS and agreed Heads of Terms to achieve a negotiated solution. Unfortunately, despite agreeing to discuss Saturday pay rates, the BMA reneged and refused to contemplate any compromise on this issue. Sir David advised that a negotiated solution to the outstanding contractual issues was impossible. He also advised that the health service now needs certainty, and as such the Government decided that the only plausible option was to press ahead with the introduction of new contracts. Changes will not be imposed on staff who currently have a contract of employment, but new terms will be offered as juniors enter or move through training and onto new contracts as current contracts expire. This is simply exercising a right that employers have when unable to reach agreement on changes with trade unions. It would not be practical or democratic to allow any trade union to exercise a veto over reforms that support the delivery of the elected Government’s manifesto commitments.The new contract is safer for patients and fairer for doctors. Tired doctors risk patient safety, so in the new contract the maximum number of hours that can be worked in one week will be reduced from 91 to 72; the maximum consecutive nights will be reduced from 7 to 4; the maximum consecutive long days will be reduced from 7 to 5; and no doctor will ever be required to be rostered consecutive weekends. We will also introduce a new ‘Guardian’ role within every Trust with the authority to impose fines for breaches to agreed working hours.  These fines will be invested in educational resources and facilities for trainees.\r\n\r\nThe new contract will give additional pay to those working Saturday evenings from 5pm, nights from 9pm to 7am, and all day on Sunday. Plain time hours will now be extended from 7am to 5pm on Saturdays. However the government was willing to be flexible on Saturday premium pay and we have been: those working 1 in 4 or more Saturdays will receive a pay premium of 30%, higher on average than that available to nurses, midwives, paramedics and most other clinical staff. It is also a higher premium than that available to fire officers, police officers or those in many other walks of life. None the less it does represent a reduction compared to current rates, necessary to ensure hospitals can afford additional weekend rostering. So because we do not want take home pay to go down for junior doctors, these changes will allow an increase of 13.5%. Three quarters of doctors will see a take home pay rise and no trainee working within contracted hours will have their pay cut.\r\n\r\nWe recognise the negotiation process has uncovered some wider and more deep-seated issues relating to junior doctors’ wellbeing and quality of life that need to be addressed. These issues include inflexibility around leave, lack of notice about placements that can be a long way away from home, separation from spouses and families, and sometimes inadequate support from employers, professional bodies and senior clinicians. The Government has therefore asked Prof. Dame Sue Bailey, President of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges to lead a review of measures outside the contract to improve morale of junior doctors. The Government has committed an extra £10billion to the NHS this Parliament, but with that extra funding must come reform to deliver safer services for patients across all 7 days of the week.",

                    "details": "The UK’s commitments on overseas aid were part of the 2015 manifesto on which the government was elected. The government is keeping its promise to the electorate, tackling global challenges in the national interest.\r\n\r\nBritain faces a simple choice: either we wait for the problems of the world to arrive on our doorstep, or we take action to tackle them at source.\r\n\r\nUK aid, whether it is helping to prevent deadly diseases like Ebola from coming to the UK from West Africa, or enabling Syrian refugees and other would-be migrants to stay in their home region, is about creating a more stable and secure world.\r\n\r\nOver the last five years, UK aid has been life-saving and life-changing for millions of the poorest people around the world. We have supported 11 million children through school. We have helped more than 60 million people get access to clean water, better sanitation and improved hygiene conditions. We are leading the global effort to save millions of girls from child marriage and Female Genital Mutilation.\r\n\r\nUK aid is spent where it is most needed and is subject to rigorous internal and external checks and scrutiny at all stages. The UK’s aid programmes are scrutinised by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, the International Development Select Committee and Public Accounts Committee in Parliament, and the National Audit Office. This is in addition to internal monitoring and evaluation to ensure projects stay on track and deliver value for taxpayers’ money.\r\n\r\nThe government has realigned the UK’s aid strategy, cutting wasteful programmes and making sure spending is firmly in the UK’s national interest. Alongside an increased defence budget and the UK’s world class diplomatic service, our aid programme is helping to create a more prosperous and stable world in which the UK can stand tall and flourish.\r\n\r\nBritain’s aid strategy recognises that tackling poverty overseas means tackling the root causes of global problems that affect all of us, such as disease, migration, and terrorism. The Department for International Development is the UK’s primary channel for aid, but to respond to the changing world, more aid will be administered by other government departments, such as the Home Office, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department of Health, and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, drawing on their complementary skills.\r\n\r\nThe government will invest more through its aid programme to tackle the causes of instability, insecurity and conflict, and to tackle crime and corruption. DFID is already working with the Metropolitan Police, National Crime Agency, and HMRC to recover funds stolen from developing countries, and help countries build proper tax systems and robust institutions so they can stand on their own two feet.\r\n\r\nThis is an approach that works; as well as delivering humanitarian aid to crisis zones and targeting the root causes of the migration crisis, it is increasing economic prospects in fragile states to help counter extremism, and helping build our future trading partners.\r\n\r\nYou can the read the full UK aid strategy here:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/478834/ODA_strategy_final_web_0905.pdf\r\n\r\nDepartment for International Development",

                    "overview": "The Petitions Committee decided not to schedule a debate on this petition because it doesn’t have the power to schedule a debate on the type of motion that could trigger a general election. \r\n \r\nThe Petitions Committee only has power to table general motions (using the form of words ‘That this House has considered e-petition [number] on [the subject of the petition]’). A debate on this petition, which asks for a debate to trigger a general election, cannot be started by a general motion. It needs a specific motion, as set out in the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011.\r\n\r\nUnder this law, the House of Commons can trigger a general election only if it agrees to certain specific motions. Early elections can be held either:\r\n• if a motion saying that there should be an early general election is agreed either (a) by at least two-thirds of the whole House in a formal vote or (b) without division (a formal vote); or\r\n• if a motion of no confidence is passed and no alternative government is confirmed by the Commons within 14 days.\r\nYou can find out more about how this law works here: http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06111\r\n\r\nThis decision by the Committee doesn’t prevent MPs debating the type of motion that could trigger a general election, if they wish to do so, at another time, so long as they follow the steps set out in the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act.\r\n\r\nSince the Petitions Committee can only schedule general debates within which the House ‘considers’ a certain issue, it is usually more effective to start a petition calling for a specific change to government policy or the law.\r\n"

                    "summary": "Global economic conditions mean this is a very difficult time for the steel industry and the workforce and communities affected. Government is doing all it can to ensure UK steel has a viable future.",
                    "details": "The UK steel sector is facing unparalleled global economic conditions.  Around the world, production of steel is 30 per cent higher than demand.  In China alone, excess steel capacity is 25 times the UK’s entire annual production.  India, Indonesia and other emerging economies are ramping up production with ready supplies of raw materials and low-paid labour.  In Europe, demand has yet to return to pre-crash levels.  When unprecedented supply is met with sluggish demand, prices inevitably fall - the international price of steel has halved over the past 18 months.\r\n\r\nThese conditions have led to many companies having to take difficult commercial decisions including redundancies across the sector and the closure of the SSI steel plant in Teesside last year.  This issue is not just a UK issue.  Since 2008 there have been many plant closures across Europe, and the number of workers in European steel manufacturing has fallen by about 70,000.\r\n\r\nThe Government has been working hard with the industry to provide all the support we can. Back in October last year Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills convened a special Steel Summit in Rotherham, alongside industry, Scottish and Welsh governments and unions.  Through three Minister-led Working Groups we have been working with the sector to tackle key industry asks.  This is now being taken forward through the Steel Council which had its first meeting on 2 March and will be meeting again soon to discuss recent developments.\r\n\r\nTo date we have paid over £160 million to steel companies and other Energy Intensive Industries (EIIs) to compensate for the cost of climate change-related energy costs, including more than £50 million to Tata.  Following state aid clearance in December we have made the first payments under the latest scheme.  We are also going further, as announced at Autumn Statement, we plan to exempt EIIs from renewable energy costs.  This will save the steel industry over £400m by the end of this Parliament.  We have also secured flexibility over the implementation of EU emissions regulations; this will save the steel industry millions of pounds.\r\n\r\nLast year we published new procurement guidance for central Government Departments, this ensures that social and economic issues are taken into account when Government procures steel.  We are the first Government in the EU to take advantage of this flexibility. We have now gone further and extended this guidance across the entire public sector and will setting up a list of approved steel suppliers.  We also continue to work with all UK steel companies to ensure that they have maximum visibility of the public procurement pipeline.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that many of the issues facing the UK steel industry are international and therefore require an international response.  This is why Sajid Javid asked for and secured an extraordinary meeting of the EU Competitiveness Council to coordinate a continent-wide approach.  We voted in favour of anti-dumping measures on wire rod and on steel pipes in July and October last year.  We have lobbied successfully for an EU investigation into cheap imports of Reinforcing Steel Bar (‘rebar’) and in February we voted in favour of measures on rebar and cold-rolled products.  We also continue to press for the speeding up of trade defence investigations.  Although it is too early to tell what the impact of the duties will be, signs are promising for measures imposed in January; imports of rebar in January 2016 were 99% down on January 2015.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises that this is a difficult time for the workers and communities affected by the current crisis, including in many areas where the steel sector makes up a substantial part of local employment.  Our immediate focus is to help those who have lost their jobs back into work as quickly as possible.  We have set aside up to £90m of support packages, and are working with Taskforces in Scunthorpe, Rotherham, Scotland and Wales to ensure we are offering all possible support to those affected.\r\n\r\nWhilst we are looking at all viable options and are not ruling anything out, we don't believe nationalisation is the right answer.  The world’s best steel companies all operate in the private sector and public ownership of steel operations has all but disappeared in the EU.  We will support the steel industry where we reasonably can but Government ownership of the steel industry, or any part of it, will not raise prices or increase demand for steel.\r\n\r\nThe Government is doing all it can to ensure a sustainable future for UK steel.  Ministers wrote to MPs to update them during recess and will continue to hold briefings to update representatives of other parties on the situation.  Our focus is on finding a long-term sustainable future for steel-making at Port Talbot and across the UK.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills",

                    "details": "In the Summer Budget 2015, we announced that, from April 2017, new Employment Support Allowance (ESA) claimants who are placed in the work-related activity group (WRAG) will receive the same rate of benefit as those claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA). \r\n\r\nThis change only affects new claims made after that date and there will be no cash losers among those who are already in receipt of ESA. This reform affects those with limited capability for work. Those with the most severe work-limiting health conditions and disabilities, who are placed in the Support Group, will be completely unaffected by these changes.\r\n\r\nThe reason for implementing this reform is clear. The current system fails to provide the right support to help those with health conditions and disabilities towards and into work, and acts to trap people on welfare. We are committed to ensuring that people have the best support possible, and that is what these changes are about.\r\n\r\nThe recent record employment levels have benefitted many but have yet to reach those on ESA.  It is important to remember that whilst 1 in 5 JSA claimants move off benefit every month, only 1 in 100 of ESA WRAG claimants does so.  Those with health conditions and disabilities deserve better than this. \r\n\r\nIn addition to providing financial security for individuals, work often has a profound effect on people’s life chances and it is right that this Government does everything it can to provide better support to get people into work.  More than three-fifths (61 per cent) of those in the ESA WRAG say they want to work – and there is a large body of evidence showing that work is generally good for physical and mental wellbeing. \r\n\r\nThis change enables us to recycle money into providing practical support that will make a significant difference to the life chances of those in the WRAG. This new funding will be worth £60 million in 2017/18 rising to £100 million in 2020/21 and will support those with limited capability for work to move towards and into suitable employment. \r\n\r\nAs set out in the Budget 2016, the nature of this support is being influenced by a Taskforce of disability charities, employers, think tanks, provider representatives and local authorities. Furthermore, we are providing a further £15 million for the Jobcentre Plus Flexible Support Fund in 2017-18 to help claimants who have limited capability for work with the extra costs that can be involved in moving closer to the labour market and into work.\r\n\r\nThese changes are part of a wider reform to help support more disabled people and those with health conditions work and to remain in work. Over the coming year we will build the progress we have made in partnership with disabled people, their representatives, and healthcare professionals, using their insights to understand how the welfare system can work better with the health and social care systems.\r\n\r\nOur reforms are aimed at improving the quality of life of those in greatest need.  Again, it is worth noting that we spend around £50 billion every year on benefits to support people with disabilities or health conditions, which represents over 6 per cent of all Government spending. We are proud of that commitment and we are determined to ensure that those most in need continue to receive the support they require. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions",

In particular, on 2 March MPs debated and voted on House of Lords amendments to the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. This included an amendment on Employment Support Allowance, which was rejected. On 7 March the bill cleared its final parliamentary stage and it is now waiting to be signed into law.  \r\n \r\nYou can read the debates at every stage of the Bill here: \r\n \r\nhttp://services.parliament.uk/bills/2015-16/welfarereformandwork.html \r\n \r\nYou can read the debate on 2 March here: \r\n \r\nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160302/debtext/160302-0003.htm#16030293000001 \r\n \r\n \r\nThe Petitions Committee is not the only way of getting a House of Commons debate on the subject of a petition. MPs could still try to get time for a further debate on this subject, if they wish to do so.

But Higher Education and Further Education must remain affordable to the taxpayer. Our approach is based on the fundamental principle that a borrower’s contribution to the cost of their education should be linked to their ability to pay. Graduates generally benefit from higher earnings than those who do not go to university, and we must maintain a fair balance between taxpayers and graduates in the costs of Higher Education. \r\n\r\nGraduates don’t have to repay their loans until they are earning above the annual threshold of £21,000. This threshold remains higher in real terms than that applicable to student loans taken out before 2012. Repayments are then made at a rate of 9% above this threshold. If a borrower earns less than the threshold then no repayments need to be made. Outstanding loans are written off 30 years after graduation.\r\n\r\nThe Government consulted on the threshold freeze in July 2015. All responses to the consultation were considered carefully in the wider context of the detailed analysis of impacts, including on the public finances, and the Equality Analysis.

                    "summary": "There will be no imposition. NHS Improvement expects employers to introduce a fairer, safer contract, which they can do for new staff and as contracts expire as juniors move through training. ",
                    "details": "Junior doctors work incredibly hard across seven days.  They make a huge contribution to the NHS and deserve a fair, professional contract that supports patient care and proper training. As NHS Employers and the British Medical Association (BMA) agreed some years ago, the current contract does not do this and needs to be replaced. Regrettably, despite negotiations over three years and agreement on 90% of the content, a settlement could not be reached and a new contract now needs to be introduced. The new deal is one which NHS leaders are clear is safe, fair and reasonable for junior doctors. Patient safety is the absolute priority for the Government and NHS Employers.  We want to ensure we have the safest healthcare system in the world by introducing stronger limits on junior doctors’ hours and by ensuring that consultants are available to make vital decisions about patient care across seven days. This requires changes to contracts.\r\n \r\nTogether, consultants and junior doctors are crucial to ensuring patients receive the high-quality care they need every day of the week. The BMA called for reform of the junior doctors’ contract in 2008. The proposals put forward for reforming the junior doctors’ contract and the consultants’ contract are designed to protect the safety of junior doctors and patients as well as rewarding junior doctors more fairly and ensuring more consultant availability over weekends to support training and deliver the key clinical standards. We have been making every effort, in good faith, to work with the BMA to introduce a new contract for junior doctors that supports these principles while maintaining average pay and ensuring no doctor is required to work longer or unsafe hours.  After the BMA walked away from negotiations with NHS Employers in 2014, we and NHS Employers accepted the recommendations of the independent Review Body on Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration in July 2015 and sought a return to negotiations. The BMA refused to negotiate, rejected an offer published and sent to junior doctors on 4 November 2015, and balloted for industrial action. \r\n \r\nThe BMA, NHS Employers and the Department agreed, in November, to talks under the auspices of ACAS and this led to negotiations during December. Initial talks led to a revised offer on 4 January, which the BMA refused to discuss, instead announcing that industrial action would commence on 12 January.. The Secretary of State appointed Sir David Dalton, a respected trust chief executive, to lead further talks behalf of the NHS and the Department. At the request of the management side, ACAS were asked to oversee those talks that continued during January with the BMA suspending further action that had been planned for 26-28 January\r\n\r\nOn 1 February Sir David Dalton wrote to the Secretary of State to advise him of the progress of negotiations. At the same time, the BMA announced industrial action for 10 February – with junior doctors providing emergency cover only, rather than the full withdrawal of labour that had previously been announced. This action was regrettable and unnecessary, given that Sir David’s letter showed that the parties had reached agreement on many issues, most notably on safety and on education and training, and on many elements of a new pay structure. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, despite agreeing to discuss Saturday pay rates, the BMA reneged and refused to contemplate any compromise on this issue. Sir David advised that a negotiated solution to the outstanding contractual issues was impossible. He also advised that the health service now needs certainty, and as such the Government decided that the only plausible option was to press ahead with the introduction of new contracts.\r\n\r\nThe Health Secretary announced on 11 February that the new contract will be introduced. NHS Improvement has made clear that it expects all employers to work with their junior doctors to implement the new contract. Changes will not be imposed on staff who currently have a contract of employment, but new terms will be offered as juniors enter training or as they move through training and onto new contracts of employment as current contracts expire. This is simply exercising a right that employers have when unable to reach agreement on changes with Trade Unions. Sir David has made clear his view that a negotiated settlement is not possible and that the proposed contract will be both safer for patients and fair and reasonable for junior doctors. Junior doctors should consider the detail that has been sent to them and published. What will be introduced is a fairer, safer contract that: includes lower limits on working hours and stronger safeguards to enforce these; better supports training; preserves average earnings, including for new trainees; includes a 13.5% increase in basic pensionable pay for all; means an increase in earnings for 75% of those moving onto new terms; and includes an offer that protects the pay of all trainees during transition.",

                    "details": "The Government believes that the UK can benefit from migration but not uncontrolled migration.  We are delivering a more selective immigration system that works in the national interest.\r\n\r\nUncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion, puts pressure on public services and can drive down wages for people on low incomes.  In the past it has been too easy for employers to bring in workers from overseas, rather than to take the long-term decision to train our workforce here at home.\r\n\r\nAs part of our reforms, we consulted in 2011 on being more selective about those workers who are allowed to settle in the UK.  We do not believe there should be an automatic link between coming to work in the UK temporarily and staying permanently.\r\n\r\nThe £35,000 threshold for settlement applications forms part of our overall strategy and is intended to make a modest contribution to the Government’s target of reducing net migration to sustainable levels.  It applies to those holding leave  under Tier 2, the skilled work category.  This category is reserved for those working in graduate level jobs only.\r\n\r\nThe threshold was set following advice from the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), an independent advisory body consisting of expert labour market economists.  The MAC carried out a further public consultation, in addition to that carried out by the Government, before arriving at its recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Tier 2 category is to support the UK economy.  The MAC advised that the strongest indicator of economic value is salary, and therefore those migrants earning more than a given amount at the end of their temporary leave in the UK should be eligible for settlement.  \r\n\r\n£35,000 was equivalent to the median pay of the UK population in skilled jobs which qualified for Tier 2 at the time of the MAC’s consultation.  The MAC’s most recent research shows that the equivalent figure today would be £39,000.\r\n\r\nWithin Tier 2, there are exemptions for migrants who are working in a PhD-level occupation (such as university researchers), or in a recognised shortage occupation.  Nurses, several other healthcare professionals and some teachers are among the jobs which are included on the Shortage Occupation List, and who will be exempt from the threshold.\r\n\r\nThis exemption also covers jobs which have been on the Shortage Occupation List at any time in the preceding six years while the settlement applicant has been sponsored to do it.  This guards against jobs being returned to shortage because migrant workers who have helped fill skills gaps are required to leave.  \r\n\r\nInternational students enter the UK under Tier 4, the student route.  There is a category in Tier 5, the temporary work route, for charity workers.  The £35,000 threshold does not apply to these categories, which have never led to settlement in the UK.  We have an excellent offer for international graduates who wish to undertake skilled work in the UK after their studies.\r\n\r\nThose workers who are affected by the threshold were aware when they entered that new settlement rules would apply to them.  We were clear that the new rules would apply to migrants who entered Tier 2 from 6 April 2011.  Employers have also had this time to prepare for the possibility their migrant workers may not meet the required salary threshold to remain in the UK permanently.\r\n\r\nThose workers who cannot meet the threshold can extend their stay in Tier 2 up to a maximum of six years, and can apply to switch into any other immigration routes for which they are eligible.\r\n\r\nHome Office",

We will continue to seek further opportunities to raise the issue, in particular as we approach the Winter Olympics in 2018, and will monitor developments in the practice in the Republic of Korea. \r\n\r\nWe believe that it is necessary to work with governments around the world to build agreement on animal welfare standards and to phase out cruel and inhumane farming and trapping practices.  \r\n\r\nWe welcome the work that non-governmental organisations, such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Change for Animals Foundation and the Humane Society International undertake with authorities of other countries to improve standards of animal welfare.\r\n\r\nParliament debated the ongoing consumption of dog meat on 5 November 2015.  The debate covered three main themes: the treatment of animals, the health risks associated with eating dog meat; and the UK’s role in reducing the trade and tackling animal welfare issues.  As we noted at that debate, while we cannot intervene directly in the protection of wildlife abroad, we will continue to raise our concerns on specific animal welfare issues with the relevant authorities.\r\n \r\nIn a number of countries, including the Republic of Korea, the sale and consumption of dog meat is legal. In the absence of international norms, laws or agreements governing the trade and consumption of cat and dog meat, the United Kingdom has no legal grounds to intervene or take trade measures against those countries where consumption of this meat is regarded as normal practice.\r\n\r\nThe practice of eating dog soup (posintang) during Boknal (three days throughout the summer) in the Republic of Korea is declining rapidly as attitudes change and the vast majority of Koreans eat samgaetang instead (chicken and ginseng soup).   The trend is such that dogmeat eating is likely to die out of its own accord, though that day could still be some years off.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office",

We are looking to transfer children who were already registered in Europe before the EU-Turkey deal came into force on 20 March, where it is in their best interests.\r\n\r\nWe must put the best interests of children first, and avoid any policy that places children at additional risk or encourages them to place their lives in the hands of the people traffickers and criminal gangs.  In any response, we need to be very careful not to inadvertently create a situation in which families see an advantage in sending children ahead, putting their lives at risk by attempting perilous sea crossings to Europe.\r\n\r\nWe will work closely with local authorities. We must ensure we fulfil our obligations to children who are already in UK, as well ensuring we have the right support for those who may be brought to the UK from Europe.\r\n\r\nWe will consult relevant NGOs, UNHCR, UNICEF and Member States on how best we implement this legislation.  The very nature of this amendment means we must take the time to consult others before bringing final proposals on how to implement.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the UK continues to take a comprehensive approach to the Syria conflict and migration crisis by providing significant aid and assistance; including our resettlement programmes.  On 4 February 2016, the Prime Minister announced that the UK will more than double our total pledge to the Syria crisis from £1.12 billion to over £2.3 billion.  This is our largest ever response to a single humanitarian crisis.  The Syrian Resettlement Scheme has already provided safe haven to more than 1000 vulnerable Syrians – around half of them children - and overall we expect children to make up a significant proportion of the 20,000 resettlement places we are providing to this group.\r\n\r\nAs announced on 21 April, we have worked closely with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to design a resettlement scheme that will protect the most vulnerable children. The new scheme has been designed with the UNHCR to resettle ‘children at risk’ from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.  The Government has committed to resettling several hundred individuals in the first year with a view to resettling up to 3000 individuals over the lifetime of this Parliament, the majority of which will be children, where the UNHCR deem it to be in their best interests. Children who are identified as at risk will be resettled with their family members or carers where appropriate.  There will be a review of the scheme at the two year mark.\r\n\r\nThis unique initiative will be the largest resettlement effort that focuses on children at risk from the MENA region.  The new scheme will be in addition to the Prime Minister’s commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees. It is also in addition to our other existing resettlement schemes. \r\n\r\nIn regards to Europe, we are providing significant assistance to Member States facing particular pressures to ensure that all refugees can have effective access to protection, wherever they are.   The UK is the largest bilateral contributor to the humanitarian response to the crisis in Europe and the Balkans with a total contribution of £65m.  This includes nearly £46 million to provide life-saving aid to migrants and refugees including food, water, hygiene kits and infant packs, and protection for the most vulnerable, as well as support to organisations helping governments build their capacity to manage arrivals in Greece and the Balkans. The efforts of the partners we fund are targeted to reach the most vulnerable - including children.\r\n\r\nIt also includes the £10m Refugee Children Fund the Department for International Development (DFID) has created to support the needs of vulnerable refugee and migrant children specifically in Europe. The fund will support three specialist and mandated organisations UNHCR, Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee to work with host authorities to care for and assist unaccompanied or separated children in Europe and the Balkans. \r\n\r\nHome Office",

In primary school this means ensuring that they master the basics of maths, reading and writing, preparing them for the challenges of the secondary school curriculum. Parents rightly expect that we check that young people are mastering these vital skills and that schools are held to account where young people have not done so.\r\n\r\nWe have set a more a challenging standard for tests at the end of Key Stage 2 to reflect the high expectations of the new national curriculum. Previous expectations for children were too low and below those of our international competitors.  \r\n\r\nThe tests do, however, measure attainment across the range of ability in assessing pupils’ knowledge and understanding of the national curriculum. The easiest questions in the tests remain of a similar standard to the easiest questions in the old tests. There are some more difficult questions at the top end of the scale to stretch more able pupils that replace the old level 6 tests. Furthermore, while it is important for parents and teachers to understand how children are performing in relation to national expectations, statutory tests only form part of the broader assessments that schools make on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nChanges to the national curriculum tests were first announced in March 2014, and since then the Department for Education and Standards and Testing Agency have provided schools with further information to help them adapt to the assessment arrangements. Sample questions were published in summer 2014 and a full set of sample tests was provided in summer 2015, giving primary schools a year to prepare.\r\n\r\nThe best way to prepare pupils remains to focus on teaching the new national curriculum. As this is the first cohort to have reached the end of the key stage it would not be fair or accurate to set the new scale using data from pupils that had studied the old national curriculum. However, this should not affect schools’ ability to prepare for the test, because each child should be pushed to reach their full potential regardless of where the final scale is set.\r\n\r\nWe recognise that significant reforms like these take time to embed and the Minister of State for Schools has recently written to Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, and to Regional Schools Commissioners to emphasise that schools are working to new, more rigorous standards this year. It is right that we have the highest expectations for every child. Where schools are failing to meet these expectations parents rightly expect us to hold them to account, because ultimately if young people fail to master the basics at this crucial stage of their education, they risk being held back for the rest of their life. The new Key Stage 2 tests form an important part of that accountability system and, therefore, not to administer them would be to undermine our shared goal of giving children the best possible start in life.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education",

                    "details": "The Government believes there is real potential for far greater use of community pharmacy and pharmacists in England: in prevention of ill health; support for healthy living; support for self-care for minor ailments and long term conditions; medication reviews in care homes; and as part of more integrated local care models.\r\n \r\nWe need a clinically focussed community pharmacy service that is better integrated with primary care and public health in line with the Five Year Forward View. This will help relieve the pressure on GPs and A&Es, ensure better use of medicines and better patient outcomes, and contribute to delivering 7 day health and care services. So the Department is consulting on how best to introduce a Pharmacy Integration Fund to help transform how pharmacists and community pharmacy will operate in the NHS, bringing clear benefits to patients and the public.\r\n\r\nSpending on health continues to grow, with a £10 billion real terms increase in NHS funding in England between 2014/15 and 2020/21, of which £6 billion will be delivered by the end of 2016/17. We want to focus spending on lifesaving treatments and cures and we expect to spend up to an extra £2 billion per year on new drugs that patients need by the end of 2020.\r\n\r\nIn the Spending Review the Government re-affirmed the need for the NHS to deliver £22 billion in efficiency savings by 2020/21 as set out in the NHS’s own plan, the Five Year Forward View. Community pharmacy is a core part of NHS primary care and has an important contribution to make as the NHS rises to these challenges. This will involve reductions in the amount of NHS funding for community pharmacies in England. However the sum will remain significant with £2.63 billion of funding for the sector in 2016/17, as compared to £2.8 billion in 2015/16.\r\n\r\nThe Government believes these efficiencies can be made within community pharmacy without compromising the quality of services or public access to them. In some parts of the country there are more pharmacies than are necessary to maintain good access. 40% of pharmacies are in clusters of 3 or more meaning that two-fifths of pharmacies are within 10 minutes walk of 2 or more other pharmacies. We will ensure that those community pharmacies upon which people depend continue to thrive and so are consulting on the introduction of a Pharmacy Access Scheme, which will provide more NHS funds to certain pharmacies compared to others, considering factors such as location and the health needs of the local population. \r\n\r\nWe want to transform the system to deliver efficiency savings and ensure the model of community pharmacy reflects patient and public expectations and developments in technology. This is the time to embrace developments in technology to provide the best possible service. Prescription journeys are still too often slow and awkward. We want to promote the use of on-line, click and collect or home delivery models, to help patients to get their prescriptions in a way that fits into their lifestyle. This is about ensuring we have a modern, efficient community pharmacy sector offering patient choice, easier access and fit for the future as well as today. \r\n\r\nWe will also consult on amending legislation to allow independent pharmacies to benefit from remote dispensing processes (known as ‘hub and spoke’) which facilitates more use of automation and increases efficient dispensing processes. This will free up pharmacists to spend more time delivering clinical and public health services to patients and the public. \r\n\r\nWe are entering into detailed discussions with the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee on the 2016/17 funding settlement for community pharmacy in England. In parallel, we are also seeking views on our proposals from across the sector and from patient groups.\r\n\r\nIn April we expect to have more details of the reforms that will be delivered from October 2016. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health",

                    "details": "No one who has seen the images coming out of Madaya and other besieged towns can say this situation is anything other than utterly appalling. The UK has been at the forefront of the response to the Syrian humanitarian crisis since day one. No country bar the US has given more, and the £1.1 billion we have released represents our largest ever response to a humanitarian crisis. British people can and should be proud of how the UK is standing by the Syrian people in their time of need.\r\n\r\nWe lobbied hard for UN Security Council resolutions 2165 and 2191, which has now been superseded by resolution 2258, enabling the UN to deliver aid across borders without the consent of the regime. As a result, 240 shipments of cross-border aid have been delivered by road to Syrians in need.\r\n\r\nOn 11 January, the UN, Red Cross and Syrian Arab Red Crescent confirmed aid convoys had arrived in the hard to reach towns of Madaya, Foah and Kefraya.  Further convoys have since arrived. These convoys are expected to enable 40,000 people inside Madaya, and 20,000 people inside Foah and Kefraya, to survive. UK funding to UN agencies directly supported these convoys with food parcels and medicine.\r\n\r\nThe UN estimates that 13.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including 6 million children. 4.5 million people live in areas that are hard to reach with humanitarian assistance, including almost 400,000 who live under siege conditions. Across Syria, Assad and other parties to the conflict are wilfully impeding humanitarian access on a day-by-day basis. It is unacceptable and illegal to use starvation as a weapon of war.\r\n\r\nThe most effective way to get food to people who are starving and stop these needless and horrific deaths is for Assad and all parties to the conflict to adhere to international humanitarian law. That is why the UK Government is calling on the Assad regime and all parties to the conflict to allow immediate and unfettered access to all areas of Syria.\r\n\r\nWe have given ongoing support to the UN and international NGOs since the start of the conflict to deliver aid to these areas.  In the past year, only 10% of all requests submitted by the UN to the regime to access besieged and hard-to-reach areas have been approved and delivered. That’s why it is vital we keep up the pressure on the regime to let aid convoys in and to provide sustained, permanent and safe humanitarian access, as provided for in UN Security Council Resolution 2258. Russia in particular, must match its words to its actions and do more to press the regime for full humanitarian access.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to use our position in the UN Security Council to draw attention to the atrocities being carried out in Syria and press for robust action, while maintaining the pressure for a political settlement to bring the suffering of the Syrian people to an end. The UK is working to bring about a political settlement to the Syria crisis through the International Syria Support Group, with the UN Special Envoy for Syria, and with the Syrian Opposition. That is because the UN, the Red Cross Movement and NGO partners are best placed to deliver aid to besieged and hard to reach areas. They have the mandate, expertise and capacity to assess needs and deliver an appropriate, timely response. We continue to press for them to be granted full access to all areas in need.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to helping Syrians in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, we do not rule anything out but, right now, air drops are not a viable way of getting help to those in need.  \r\n\r\nUse of air drops to deliver aid is high risk and should only be considered as a last resort when all other means have failed, and it is an effective way of getting humanitarian supplies to people. Air drops require certain conditions to be met for successful delivery that are unlikely to be present on the ground in Syria.  There is a requirement to identify clear drop zones, ensure safe access for the intended recipients, and to co-ordinate with authorities on the ground.  Crucially, air drops do not provide the sustained access that humanitarian actors normally need to conduct needs assessments, oversee distribution, provide medical treatment and conduct evacuations. They are also limited in capability: for example, water cannot be dropped on the scale required and there is no way of ensuring items dropped will reach the most vulnerable. The UN is not currently calling for their use.\r\n\r\nWe will not stop in our efforts, whether through hard work on a political solution that will deal with the root cause of the problem or through humanitarian efforts, which provide immediate, life-saving relief. This shocking situation underlines the vital work of aid agencies and shows how important it is that they have the assurance of knowing that they have the resources to keep going. It also underlines the importance of February’s Supporting Syria and the Region conference in London, which we will co-host.",

                    "details": "Anyone with the ability to benefit from higher education should have the opportunity to do so, irrespective of their background. That is why all eligible students can apply for an upfront tuition fee loan to meet the full costs of their tuition fees, as well as loans for living costs. \r\n\r\nLoans are only repaid once students are earning over £21,000 a year. Students earning below £21,000 will not have to make repayments. Deductions are taken at 9% of any income over that threshold and any outstanding balance will be written off after 30 years.\r\n\r\nEligible full-time students from some of the most disadvantaged backgrounds will also receive 10.3% more living cost support in 2016/17 than under previous student support arrangements.\r\n\r\nIn order to charge tuition fees above the basic amount of £6,000 and up to the £9,000 fee cap, higher education institutions are required to agree an access agreement with the Director for Fair Access. Higher education institutions are expected to spend £745 million through these access agreements in 2016/17, this has risen from £395 in 2009/10.  This will be invested in measures to improve the access to university and successful outcomes of disadvantaged students.\r\n\r\nThe steps we have taken to ensure higher education remains sustainably financed has enabled us to lift student number controls, so that more people have the opportunity to secure a university place. The proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds entering higher education is up from 13.6% in 2009 to 18.5% in 2015. \r\n\r\nLowering tuition fees would carry a number of possible consequences, including a cut to funding for universities and additional demands on public spending, which would be met through higher taxation, including on those who have not themselves benefited from university. This could also mean the re-imposition of student number controls, leading to fewer university places being available for students.]\r\n\r\nThe Government’s approach has struck the right balance between delivering a sustainable system and ensuring higher education remains open and accessible. This has been recognised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which said we are “one of the few countries to have figured out a sustainable approach to student finance”. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills",

                    "details": "The Government is aware that the cost of motor insurance can be high for new drivers and understands the concerns that have been expressed about this. The average cost of motor insurance for the 17-22 age group was estimated to be £1277 as at January 2016 (MoneySavingExpert.com).\r\n\r\nIt is important to bear in mind that motor insurers have to provide unlimited cover against the risk of personal injury to third parties and cover of up to one million pounds for property damage.  \r\n\r\nThey use a wide range of criteria to assess the potential risk a driver poses and this includes the age of the applicant, the type of vehicle being driven, the postal area where the applicant lives and his/her driving experience.\r\n\r\nFigures from insurers show that as many as one-fifth of newly qualified drivers make a claim within the first six months. \r\n\r\nWhilst Government cannot intervene directly in the setting of premiums, what it can do is help to establish a situation where young and newly qualified drivers are better equipped for a life of independent driving.   \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Government has taken forward a programme of measures to strengthen the way people learn to drive and are tested and to provide opportunities for additional training for newly-qualified drivers.  We have also engaged insurers in this process, so that they can have confidence that additional measures will make a real difference that can be rewarded.\r\n\r\nWe are focussing our efforts on encouraging learner drivers to do more practice and to practise in a wider range of driving conditions; on ensuring that the driving test assesses the skills needed for today’s roads and vehicles and those of the future; and on identifying the most promising behavioural, educational and technological interventions that can reduce young driver casualties. The Government’s Road Safety Statement, published on 21 December 2015, announced a £2 million research programme to identify the best possible interventions for learner and novice drivers.\r\n\r\nThe Road Safety Statement also conveyed the Government’s wider commitment to addressing concerns about motor insurance premiums for all drivers. It says:\r\n“We will support innovation in the motoring insurance market so premiums become more responsive to safer driver behaviour and vehicle choice. This could include extending the ‘reward based’ insurance approach pioneered through young driver telematics products to the wider motoring community and fleets.” \r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport\r\n",

Students continuing their courses who were already in receipt of a maintenance grant will continue to receive one. \r\n\r\nNew students will have more money under the new student support living costs arrangements when they embark on their degree, as the Government has increased the loan for living costs to the highest level on record for eligible students from low income backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to maintaining the UK’s world class Higher Education (HE) system.  As we enable more students than ever before to study, we must also ensure that the system remains financially sustainable.  It remains a fundamental principle that a borrower’s contribution to the cost of their education should be linked to their ability to repay, maintaining a fair balance between taxpayers and graduates in the costs of HE.\r\n\r\nBorrowers will begin to repay their loans once they earn over the repayment threshold of £21,000 from April 2016. Deductions are taken at 9% of any income over that threshold and any outstanding balance will be written off after 30 years.  The student loan repayment system protects lower earning borrowers, while those who earn more will pay back more quickly.  \r\n\r\nThere is a legal obligation on all borrowers to remain in contact with SLC, providing updates on their location, circumstances and income, and to make repayments if their income is above the repayment threshold. There are currently no plans to make it a criminal offence not to repay a student loan, but the Government will take stronger action under civil law to trace borrowers and to recover loans where it is clear that those borrowers are seeking to avoid repayment. This is fair to those borrowers who meet their repayment obligations, and to taxpayers who underwrite the student loans system.\r\n\r\nA guiding principle in the Government’s approach to managing public money is Zero Tolerance for fraud.

There is no plan to remove performing arts from the school curriculum. \r\nAll state-funded schools must provide a broad and balanced curriculum that promotes the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils.  In maintained schools music and art and design are compulsory subjects within the national curriculum for 5-14-year-olds.  Maintained ‎schools are also required to teach their pupils dance, as part of the PE curriculum for 5-14-year-olds and drama, as part of the English curriculum for 5-16-year-olds.  At key stage 4 all pupils in maintained schools have an entitlement to study an arts subject if they wish.  \r\n \r\nPerforming arts subjects have not been removed from the exam system.  GCSEs and A levels in these subjects have been reformed, as they have in many other subjects. From September 2016, schools will be teaching new GCSEs in music, dance and drama and new AS and A levels in music and in drama and theatre.\r\nThe more general performing arts GCSE, AS and A levels are, however, being discontinued.   Exam boards were invited to submit proposals regarding the subjects they wanted to reform for teaching from 2017. They did not put forward proposals to develop reformed content requirements for GCSEs in Performing Arts (or AS and A Levels in Performance Studies or Performing Arts). Much of the content in the unreformed performing arts qualifications is covered in the reformed qualifications of music, drama, and dance, which are ready for first teaching in 2016. As a result of the overlap, the performing arts GCSE is being withdrawn. \r\nHowever, 107 Technical Awards will be available in a wide range of subjects from September 2016, including 6 qualifications in Performing Arts. Technical Awards are broad, high-quality level 1 and level 2 qualifications in non-EBacc subjects that equip students aged 14-16 with applied knowledge and associated practical skills not usually acquired through GCSEs.\r\nThe Government believes that participating in the performing arts is important for all students, whether or not they wish to study those subjects at GCSE or take up a career in this field. The performing arts are an effective way for pupils to develop communication skills, self-confidence, and resilience, all of which help develop character and prepare children for adult life.\r\nGovernment support is available to many students who wish to take up careers in the performing arts. The Music and Dance Scheme and Dance and Drama Awards Scheme provide means-tested support to ensure that talented children and young people from all backgrounds are able to receive the world-class training they need to succeed in careers in music, dancing and acting. Around 3,500 students a year benefit from this support.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education",

                    "summary": "Qualified healthcare professionals carry out Work Capability Assessments providing independent advice to DWP Decision Makers who determine benefit entitlement taking account of all available evidence.",
                    "details": "The Work Capability Assessment (WCA) was developed in consultation with medical and other experts, including representative groups to ensure it is appropriate for all conditions. It has a focus on the functional capability of claimants to work and on the impact of mental health conditions on functional capability. The premise of the WCA is that eligibility for benefits should not be based on a person’s condition, but rather on the way that condition limits their ability to function. We are committed to ensuring that the WCA assesses people as fairly and accurately as possible, which is why we keep our processes under constant review.\r\n\r\nAll Healthcare professionals (HCPs) carrying out WCAs on behalf of the Centre for Health and Disability Assessments (CHDA) must be registered doctors, nurses or physiotherapists who are required to have a minimum level of previous clinical experience. They also undergo training in Disability Assessment Medicine and must demonstrate an up to date knowledge of relevant clinical subjects. Before a HCP can carry out WCAs they must go through a formal Approval Process to ensure they meet the Department’s requirements in relation to experience, skills and competence and all HCPs must undergo a Continuing Medical Education (CME) programme for practitioners and are subject to regular audit. Failure to complete the mandatory CME and/or failure to maintain the required standards at audit will result in approval being revoked. \r\n\r\nA HCP makes an independent recommendation on an individual’s functional capability to work to a Decision Maker who will take into account all available evidence, including the HCP’s advice, the assessment report and any evidence provided by the claimant’s GP or consultant. In addition, claimants are encouraged to provide all evidence that will be relevant to their case at the outset of the claim, including medical evidence supplied by their GP or other medical professionals, such as support workers, carers and community psychiatric nurses.\r\n\r\nAlthough GPs are responsible for issuing medical statements (fitnote) to patients at the outset of a claim to Employment and Support Allowance, they are not responsible for making the decision on eligibility for benefit. There are a number of reasons for this.  GPs and their representative body, the British Medical Association have made it clear that they do not want to be guardians of the benefit system. The primary role of the GP or hospital doctor is to diagnose and treat any medical conditions that the patient presents to them and a clinician does not routinely consider the functional restrictions or disabling effects of the medical conditions that they treat. They are unlikely to have received specific training in assessing disabilities in their medical education, and may have considerable difficulty in giving an accurate assessment or forming an opinion in relation to the functional restrictions experienced by their patient.

They will also strengthen the UK’s world-class capabilities in research and innovation.\r\n\r\nOur higher education sector is among our greatest national assets. England’s universities rank among the best in the world. They generate the knowledge and skills that fuel our economy and provide the basis for our nation’s intellectual and cultural success.\r\n\r\nHowever, our higher education system is falling short when it comes to delivering value for money for students, employers and taxpayers, and is not fulfilling its full potential as an engine of social mobility and driver of enhanced productivity. \r\n\r\nAll students, regardless of their background, deserve excellent teaching that helps them fulfil their potential. The Teaching Excellence Framework will put in place reputational and financial incentives that will drive up the standard of teaching in all universities, and will put clear, understandable information about outcomes in the hands of students so they know where teaching is best and what benefits they can expect to gain from their course. \r\n\t\r\nThe £9,000 fee cap set in 2012 is now worth £8,500 in real terms, and we cannot allow a situation where our world-class universities are under-funded. As is provided for in the 2004 legislation we will therefore allow high quality providers the opportunity to increase the maximum fees in line with inflation, meaning they will remain flat in real terms. \r\n\r\nYoung people from disadvantaged backgrounds have not been put off going to university with entry rates at a record level of 18.5% in 2015 (compared to 13.6% in 2009). Our repayments system is based on the ability to pay. Repayments start only once a student’s income reaches over £21,000. \r\n\r\nWe are committed to maintaining a system which does not allow entry and growth from poor quality and financially unsustainable providers and deals with poor quality providers already in the system.  In order to be eligible for degree awarding powers, a provider must meet tough quality and Financial Sustainability, Management and Governance criteria. And only once a provider has successfully operated with full degree awarding powers for three years will they become eligible for university title. Nonetheless, our reforms will level the playing field for high quality new entrants, improving the capacity and agility of the higher education sector to respond to the needs of students.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills",

                    "summary": "Defra is working with key interested parties to ensure the sustainable management of uplands, balancing environmental and economic benefits, which includes the role of sustainable grouse shooting.",
                    "details": "When carried out according to the law, grouse shooting is a legitimate activity and in addition to its significant economic contribution, providing jobs and investment in some of our most remote areas, it can offer important benefits for wildlife and habitat conservation. The Government’s position is that people should be free to undertake any lawful activities. However, all those involved are encouraged to follow best practice.\r\n\r\nA report by the UK shooting community (Public & Corporate Economic Consultants report 2014: The Value of Shooting) concludes that the overall environmental and economic impact of game bird shooting is positive, and industry has estimated that £250 million per year is spent on management activities substantially benefiting conservation. For grouse shooting in particular, according to the Moorland Association, estates in England and Wales spend £52.5 million each year on managing 175 grouse moors. The industry also supports 1,520 full time equivalent jobs and is worth £67.7 million in England and Wales.  \r\n\r\nGrouse shooting takes place in upland areas, which are important for delivering a range of valuable “ecosystem services”, including food and fibre, water regulation, carbon storage, biodiversity, and recreational opportunities for health and wellbeing. The Government is committed to helping create a more sustainable future for the English uplands, including by protecting peatlands through measures such as the Peatland Code. \r\n\r\nWith regard to predator control, we welcome the proactive approach taken by game keeping organisations to ensure a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship between shooting and conservation, for example through the BASC green shoots initiative. Control of grouse predators such as foxes and stoats on shooting estates has a role to play in the recovery of rare or declining species, particularly ground nesting birds. Mountain hares and other tick carrying species such as deer are controlled to reduce disease mortality in infected red grouse chicks. We also recognize that controlling mountain hares and deer is a legitimate practice in other circumstances: for example, to protect young trees and vegetation or as quarry species. \r\n \r\nThe Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 affords protection to all wild birds; despite this, incidents of illegal killing of birds of prey continue, so we have identified raptor persecution as a national wildlife crime priority. Each wildlife crime priority has a delivery group to consider what action should be taken, and develop a plan to prevent crime, gather intelligence on offences and enforce against it. The raptor persecution group, led by a senior police officer, focuses on the golden eagle, goshawk, hen harrier, peregrine, red kite and white tailed eagle and is led by a senior police officer. \r\n\r\nThe National Wildlife Crime Unit, which is part-funded by Defra, monitors and gathers intelligence on illegal activities affecting birds of prey and assists police forces when required. Despite instances of poisoning and killing of birds of prey, populations of many species, such as the peregrine, red kite and buzzard have increased.  \r\n\r\nWith regard to hen harriers, in January 2016 the Defra led Upland Stakeholder Forum hen harrier sub-group published the Joint action plan to increase the English hen harrier population. This sets out six complementary actions to increase hen harrier populations in England. These actions are individually beneficial, and when combined have the potential to deliver stronger outcomes and contribute to the recovery of the hen harrier population in England. These are:\r\n\r\n1: Monitoring of populations in England and UK\r\n\r\n2: Diversionary feeding\r\n\r\n3: Work with Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group (RPPDG) to analyse monitoring information and build intelligence picture\r\n\r\n4: Nest and winter roost protection\r\n\r\n5: Southern reintroduction\r\n\r\n6: Trialling a Brood Management Scheme\r\n\r\nThe Action Plan sets out who leads on each action and the timescale and benefits of each. The plan was developed with senior representatives from organisations best placed to take action, including Natural England, the Moorland Association, the National Gamekeepers’ Organisation, the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust, National Parks England and the RSPB. These organisations will now take the plan forward led by Natural England. They will monitor all the activities carried out and report annually on progress to the Defra Uplands Stakeholder Forum and the UK Tasking and Co-ordinating group for Wildlife Crime.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs",

                    "details": "The Consumer Rights Act 2015 introduced new requirements in relation to the re-sale of tickets through online secondary ticketing facilities for recreational, sporting or cultural events in the UK.  These came into force on 27 May 2015.\r\n\r\nThe Act placed new obligations to provide information about tickets on both ticket re-sellers and the secondary ticketing facilities and are aimed at providing transparency and protection for consumers.  The measures include the duty to provide information about certain connections the seller might have with either the online facility on which they are selling, or the organiser of the event for which the ticket is being sold.  Other consumer legislation requires the identification of the seller, where they are acting as a ‘trader’.\r\n\r\nThe secondary ticketing provisions were introduced in recognition of concerns raised in Parliament that the ticket re-sale secondary market was not functioning correctly and that consumers risked not being sufficiently protected.  \r\n\r\nLocal authority trading standards services have a duty to enforce the secondary\r\nticketing provisions of the 2015 Act in Great Britain (the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment is the relevant enforcer for Northern Ireland).  They also enforce other consumer protection legislation, which may be relevant to ticketing.  Suspected or actual breaches of such legislation should first be reported via the Citizens Advice consumer helpline, following which Citizens Advice may refer cases to Trading Standards Services for appropriate action. The Government expects all sellers, secondary ticketing facilities and event organisers to comply with the Act’s secondary ticketing provisions that apply to them, as well as with any other relevant law, including consumer protection, copyright and taxation.    \r\n\r\nIn addition to the obligations described above, the Act required that a review of consumer protection measures should be undertaken. In October 2015, Professor Michael Waterson was appointed to carry out an independent review and his report was published on 26 May 2016:  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consumer-protection-measures-applying-to-ticket-resale-waterson-review\r\n\r\nProfessor Waterson considers how tickets come to the secondary market and how pricing, ticketing and venue control are intimately linked. He has recommended a number of practical actions that companies in both the primary and secondary ticket markets could take to increase transparency on ticketing for the consumer.  He believes that the primary ticketing market should do more to protect itself from ‘bots’ that mass purchase tickets, including reporting 'bot' attacks to the Police. And he says the secondary sites should do more to ensure sellers using them comply with the provisions in the Consumer Rights Act 2015. For reasons he sets out in his Report, Professor Waterson is not convinced that price capping is an appropriate solution to issues in the market at this time.\r\n\r\nThe Government will consider Professor Waterson’s Report and respond to it in due course.  \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills",

                    "details": "The Government is concerned about the decline of the hedgehog. Whilst the reasons for the decline in numbers of this emblematic species are complex, we support efforts to make our gardens more hedgehog friendly and more friendly to wildlife generally and pollinators specifically.\r\n\r\nTo encourage the involvement of local communities we recently published advice for homeowners in the form of five simple steps to make gardens more hedgehog friendly. This advice can be accessed at: www.gov.uk/government/news/five-simple-steps-to-transform-gardens-in-to-hedgehog-havens\r\n\r\nWe are impressed by the good work of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society and the People’s Trust for Endangered Species in undertaking surveys to establish the facts and engaging the public, and support the majority of their 10 year strategy for the protection of hedgehogs. The Taxon Group, which is being led by Natural England, is also proposing a number of actions that address some of the objectives of the 10 year Strategy.\r\n\r\nHedgehogs are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 from being killed using prohibited methods such as a crossbows, traps and snares. However, further protection of hedgehogs by adding them to Schedule 5 will not support the species and may have unintended consequences because:\r\n\r\no\tthe legislation makes it an offence to intentionally kill, take and injure and we have no evidence that this is currently an issue;\r\no\tprotecting such a generalist habitat from destruction or disturbance could have the unintended consequence of making it a criminal offence to tend gardens; and\r\no\tit may deter the maintenance and creation of habitat for hedgehogs if there will be a restriction on land use as a result.\r\n\r\nSince 2010 we have overseen work to create and restore over 100,000 hectares of priority habitat. Frontline programmes such as our agri-environment schemes have already restored or planted 30,000 kilometres of hedgerows. The new £900 million Countryside Stewardship scheme which started this year will further add to this valuable work by helping farmers, foresters and other land managers play a pivotal role in protection our wildlife and the countryside in general. In addition, the hedgerows and boundaries capital grants (part of Countryside Stewardship) announced on 1 February will also have a valuable part to play.\r\n\r\nWe are developing an ambitious 25 Year plan to protect and enhance our environment. It will move us to a more integrated and effective approach to managing our environment, placing local people and places at the heart of environmental decision making. This new approach will help equip people with the knowledge and power they need to take effective action on local environmental priorities, helping reverse the decline of iconic species like hedgehogs as part of this joined up approach.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs",

                    "details": "Every part of our natural environment from our coasts, to our great landscapes, and clean air to productive soils, is a vital part of the success of our country; nature doesn’t exist in silos. By managing the environment in an integrated way we will gain key environmental, economic and social benefits. We are working on a 25 Year Environment Plan which will set out how we will deliver the best natural environment anywhere by making more integrated decisions, using catchments and landscapes as the building blocks rather than single species or features. This makes sense because we will deliver the most effective and efficient environmental improvements if we work with the natural systems that underpin the health of our environment. \r\n\r\nWe will structure our work around river catchments and landscapes that make up the environment. For the first time, we will have a plan and budget for each area rather than several organisations operating with different plans. We are going to be integrating these plans with the 25-year Plan. As part of this we will be starting four catchment pathfinder projects later this year— in a catchment, marine, and urban setting as well as one in a large rural landscape.\r\n\r\nWe also need to value our environmental assets for the full range of benefits they provide and incorporate this into the decisions we make. Using natural capital principles can help all of us to do this better, equipping us with a robust and consistent evidence base that can inform practical action on the ground.  Data and technology are powerful tools to drive environmental understanding and improvement and Defra has committed to releasing 8,000 data sets by June 2016 to help spur this innovation and development. The tools being designed will give a consistent framework to empower local people to take decisions nationally and locally. For example, natural capital accounting will help calculate where woodland planting would provide the greatest benefits for plants and animals, recreation and reduced flood risk alongside the economic gains for forestry and farming. \r\n\r\nDefra continues to support a number of leading research and demonstration projects to better understand the role that land management changes in our landscapes and catchments, such as tree planting, peatland restoration and habitat creation, could have in reducing flood risk.  These include the Forest Research led ‘Slowing the Flow Partnership’ in Pickering, North Yorkshire, the National Trust led project at Holnicote Estate in North Somerset and the Making Space for Water’s project on the Upper Derwent catchment in Derbyshire.\r\n\r\nThese projects indicate that woodlands can slow the flow of water through smaller catchments and reduce the impacts of some floods.  We will continue to support such investigations, gathering further evidence into the potential benefits that land management changes, such as tree planting in catchments, could have on reducing flood risk, in addition to the wider environmental and economic benefits that they could provide.\r\n\r\nWe are also supporting ongoing Forestry Commission research into the role that woodlands could play in reducing flood risk. The England Woodland Grant Scheme has already targeted 1,857 hectares of planting to help reduce flood risk and diffuse pollution in England. We have also designed the Countryside Stewardship Scheme in the new Rural Development Programme to help achieve multi-objectives including flooding and water management. \r\n\r\nAfter the recent storms, it is also important to look at what happened and to learn lessons. That is why we have commissioned an in-depth review. This will give us a chance to look at our defences and ways of modelling to explore new ways of tackling floods in the future. This includes upstream land management options for slowing the flow to reduce the intensity of flood peak and build stronger links between local residents, community groups and flood defence planning. \r\n\r\nThe framework setting out the key themes for the 25-year environment plan will be published in spring 2016 and we’ll be working with a range of interested parties over 2016 to develop the full plan.\t\r\n\r\nDepartment of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs",

                    "details": "Pupils already take Key Stage 1 tests in Year 2. Teachers use these tests to inform the judgements they report to parents and the Department about their pupils. \r\n\r\nWe have developed new tests with a more challenging expected standard to align with the high expectations within the new national curriculum. Our reformed education system has been designed to set expectations that match those in the highest performing jurisdictions internationally. Previous national expectations for primary school pupils were too low and left 1 in 3 children starting secondary school unable to read, write and add-up properly. We make no apology for setting high aspirations for all children and encouraging schools to support every one of their pupils to succeed.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that changes to the national curriculum tests were first announced in March 2014, and since then the Department for Education and Standards and Testing Agency have provided schools with further information to help them prepare for the assessment arrangements. In addition to sample questions published in summer 2014, complete sample tests were published in summer 2015 to give primary schools nearly a year of lead-in time to ensure their pupils are adequately prepared. \r\n\r\nWhile the new tests have a more challenging expected standard, they do measure attainment across the range of ability in assessing pupils’ knowledge and understanding of the national curriculum. The easiest questions in the tests remain of a similar standard to the easiest questions in the old tests. There are, however, some more difficult questions at the top end of the scale to stretch more able pupils. Furthermore, it is important for parents and teachers to understand how children are performing in relation to national expectations, but statutory tests only form part of the broader assessments that schools make on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nThe removal of national curriculum levels has helped to put classroom assessment back in the hands of teachers by giving schools the freedom to develop their own approaches to assessment within key stages. Levels had a damaging impact on teaching. They encouraging pace over consolidation and incentivising teachers to focus on pupils at level boundaries. Their removal is ensuring that assessment returns to its real purpose of evaluating pupils’ knowledge and understanding of curriculum content. It is allowing teachers to focus on what they do best – teach. The report of the Commission on Assessment Without Levels provides clear guidance and advice for schools to support them in developing high-quality assessment systems This can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commission-on-assessment-without-levels-final-report\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do recognise that significant reforms like these take time to embed and the Minister of State for Schools has recently written to Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, and to Regional Schools Commissioners to emphasise that schools are in a process of transition. \r\n\r\nPrimary school standards are rising and the new assessment system will ensure that the work of dedicated teachers throughout the country is recognised and encouraged for years to come. The new Key Stage 1 tests form an important part of that recognition and not to administer them would undermine our shared goal of giving children the best possible education.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education",

                    "details": "The GCSE English literature content requires students to read the full texts of the books, drama and poems they study. It requires students to study a range of intellectually challenging and substantial whole texts in detail including Shakespeare, 19th-century novels, Romantic poetry, and fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards. The content requires students to study no fewer than 15 poems by at least five different poets, and a minimum of 300 lines of poetry. The assessment arrangements must reflect those requirements and is designed to reward students who have gained a deep understanding of literature and who have read widely throughout the course.\r\n\r\nThe content also requires that students are examined on texts which they have not read previously (‘unseen’ texts).  Students will need to read widely during their studies to prepare them for the ‘unseen’ text in the exam and to be able to compare and contrast a range of texts using ‘relevant quotation and detailed textual references’ to demonstrate the breadth of their understanding of literature. These ‘unseen’ texts might, but do not have to be, by authors whose works students have studied as set texts. \r\n \r\nWe do not expect awarding organisations to give or allow students to have access during their exams to copies of the whole texts they have studied. Exam boards can, however, provide students with relevant extracts. The exam boards have each chosen in their sample assessment materials to provide students with extracts of the texts they have studied. \r\n\r\nStudents will not achieve high marks in GCSE English Literature simply by memorising and writing out the poems or texts they have studied.  Students will not need to learn and remember the exact words of poems or texts by heart or write those out in full in the exam in order to succeed.  \r\n\r\nTo gain good marks, students will need to be able to show that they are familiar with the texts - that they have studied them – and that their understanding is sufficiently developed to be able to compare them with other texts that might have been given to them in the exam. The student will need to write about a poem they have studied and that is not given to them in the exam, but that does not require them to reproduce the text in full.  \r\n \r\nThe Chief Regulator’s blog written last year made it clear that GCSE English literature is about understanding not memory https://ofqual.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/18/gcse-english-literature-learning-and-understanding-not-memory/\r\nOfqual’s Regulatory Conditions and Guidance documents for GCSE English are available here https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/448680/2015-07-27-gcse-subject-level-conditions-and-requirements-for-english-literature-version-3.pdf.\r\n\r\nNote: The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) is the independent regulator responsible for overseeing and maintaining standards in qualifications. The government is responsible for the content of the new GCSE English Literature qualification while Ofqual is responsible for the assessment arrangements exam boards must apply to the qualification.  GCSEs taken in England have been reformed so they are more rigorous and challenging.

Counting Officers will certify the local result and make a public declaration as to the votes cast when directed to do so by the Regional Counting Officer (or Chief Counting Officer). \r\n\r\nThere is provision for each permitted participant (or referendum campaigner) to appoint referendum agents who may attend each local count, and referendum agents may appoint counting agents to attend each count in order to observe proceedings (i.e. the verification and counting of ballot papers).  Counting Officers are responsible for adjudicating on any doubtful ballot papers and may reject a ballot paper on certain grounds, for example, where the voter’s intention is not certain.  Counting Officers are required to endorse the word “rejected” on any ballot paper which he/she decides is not be counted, and must add the words “rejection objected to” if an objection is made by a counting agent.\r\n\r\nCounting agents may ask to have the votes for their voting area re-counted, which the Counting Officer will agree to if, in the Counting Officer’s opinion, the request is reasonable in the circumstances.  \r\n\r\nGuidance that the Electoral Commission has issued on administering the referendum advises that Counting Officers should share the provisional local totals with the referendum and counting agents, and make clear that they are entitled to request a re-count. This should be undertaken within the framework of maximum openness and transparency so that all campaigners and agents can have confidence in the processes and the provisional local totals provided.\r\n\r\nThere is also provision for a Regional Counting Officer (or the Chief Counting Officer) to direct a Counting Officer to re-count the votes in their voting area if the Regional (or Chief) Counting Officer thinks there is reason to doubt the accuracy of the counting of votes in the voting area.  \r\n\r\nA Counting Officer may not conduct a re-count once a direction has been given by the Regional Counting Officer (or Chief Counting Officer) to certify the local result.  \r\n\r\nThe Electoral Commission’s guidance makes clear that accurate local totals for each voting area are fundamental to an accurate result in which voters can have confidence, and that re-counts can only take place at voting area level.  The Commission advises Counting Officers to make it clear to agents when sharing provisional local totals with them that this is their opportunity to request a re-count and that there is no provision for regional or national re-counts.  This approach is consistent with that taken at UK general elections, the Parliamentary Voting System referendum in 2011 and the Scottish Independence referendum in 2014.\r\n\r\nThe usual processes for election and referendum observers will also apply for the EU referendum.  Any individual or organisation can apply to the Electoral Commission for accreditation to be an observer. Authorised observers may observe proceedings at the poll, at the issue and receipt of postal ballot papers, and at the counting of votes.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office",

The 1972 Joint Communique between the United Kingdom and China set out that: ‘The UK acknowledges the Chinese position that Taiwan is a province of the People’s Republic of China and recognises the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China’. \r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom believes that the Taiwan issue should be resolved through dialogue, in line with the views of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.  Recent years have seen a substantial increase in transport, tourism and trade links across the Strait, which have contributed to peace and stability. We hope that this trend will continue. \r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom and Taiwan have a strong but unofficial relationship, based on dynamic commercial, educational and cultural ties and facilitated by The British Office, Taipei, and the Taipei Representative Office in London. This relationship delivers significant benefits to both the UK and Taiwan and has featured a wide range of exchanges and visits, for example on environmental, judicial and educational issues. \r\n\r\nWe encourage British companies to take advantage of Taiwan’s thriving economy, favourable business environment and close trade and investment links with the wider region. Taiwan is the UK’s 6th largest market in the Asia Pacific region. Two-way trade reached a historic high of £5.8bn in 2014 with the total value of exports of UK goods and services to Taiwan standing at £1.96bn. UK exports to Taiwan grew by 2.3% in 2014.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom and Taiwan also enjoy a constructive relationship in a range of multilateral organisations for which statehood is not a requirement, such as the WTO, and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. \r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office",

                    "details": "The partisan description of the government in this petition is wrong and the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, which came into force in 2011 under the Coalition Government, removed the power to set the general election date, and therefore to call a snap general election, from the Government and gave a power to the House of Commons to call an early general election in certain circumstances.  \r\n \r\nAn early general election can only be called under the Act if either a motion (as worded in section 2(2) of the Act) that there shall be an early parliamentary general election is passed by the House of Commons with at least two thirds in favour of the motion; or if a motion of no confidence (as worded in section 2(4) of the Act) is passed by the House of Commons and the House does not pass a motion of confidence (as worded in section 2(5) of the Act) in the Government or an alternative Government within 14 days.  Aside from these triggers there is no way to replace the Government through an early General Election.\r\n\r\nFinally, we disagree with the description of the current Government in this petition.\r\n\r\nCabinet Office\r\n",
